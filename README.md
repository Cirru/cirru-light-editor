### Usage

The editor is quite rough yet:

```bash
npm install -g cirru-light-editor # it's based on Node.js
mkdir demo/
touch demo/core.clj.json # prepare at least one file
touch demo/lib.clj.json # prepare at least one file
cle demo/ # starts the server
```

Then you may visit http://repo.cirru.org/light-editor/
and found it connected to `localhost:7001` and you can try editing.
